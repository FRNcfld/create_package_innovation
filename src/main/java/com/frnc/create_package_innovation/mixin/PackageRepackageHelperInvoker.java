/**
 * Invoker bridge to PackageRepackageHelper's PROTECTED repackBasedOnRecipes.
 *
 * Partial repackaging calls this directly for non-final passes: it crafts
 * min(ordered, affordable) per recipe from a pooled InventorySummary (mutating
 * the pool by consuming ingredients) and returns one BigItemStack per recipe
 * whose count is how many crafts the current materials afforded. It does NOT
 * addAddress and does NOT export leftovers — exactly the behavior a partial
 * pass needs (vanilla's public repack() would additionally close out the order
 * by exporting all remaining items, which is only correct for the final pass).
 *
 * Interface mixin: @Invoker methods are turned into call bridges by the
 * transformer, not merged as new methods, so the §3.9.5 visibility rule
 * (no public/static plain methods in mixin classes) does not apply here.
