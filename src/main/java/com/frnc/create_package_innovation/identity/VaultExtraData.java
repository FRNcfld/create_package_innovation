 * BlockEntity — see {@code ItemVaultBlockEntityMixin} and TECHNICAL.md §3.11.
 *
 * <p>This is a plain {@code record} (immutable, value-equality) carrying at most one
 * {@link UUID}. It flows through Create's {@code Object}-typed channel opaquely: Create
 * only ever passes the instance between the three methods on multiblock reshape, never
 * inspecting its contents, so any non-null {@code Object} subclass works.</p>

 * <p>{@code vaultId} may be {@code null} when a fresh vault has not yet been assigned a
 * UUID; receivers must null-check before using.</p>
